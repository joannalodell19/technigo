      A URL or, as itâ€™s most commonly known, a web address, refers to a web source that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. URL is an acronym and stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is type of URI, Uniform Resource Identifier, however the two terms are used interchangeably by many people. The most common occurrence of URLs are to reference web pages (http) but they are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto) and many other applications. 
  
  <p>The URL is often displayed above the web page in an address bar. Typically a URL have the form <u>http://www.example.com/index.html</u>, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html) </p>
